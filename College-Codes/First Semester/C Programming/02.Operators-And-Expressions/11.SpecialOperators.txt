Special Operators
    - C supports some special operators such as comma operator (,), sizeof operator, pointer operators (& and *) and member selection operators (. and ->).
    - We just discussed only about comma and sizeof operators here. 

    1. Comma operator
        - used to link related operations together.
        - A comma-linked list of expressions are evaluated from:
            - left-to-right
            - and the value of right-most expression is the value of the combined expression.
        For Example:
            The statement
			        value = (x=10, y=5, x+y);
	            - This will first assigns the value 10 to x, then assigns 5 to y and finally assigns 15 (i.e. 10+5) to value.
        - Since comma operator has the lowest precedence of all operators, the parentheses are necessary.
