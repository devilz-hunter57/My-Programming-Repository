    1. Start
    2. Read the initial values of x & y, say x0 and y0.
    3. Read the values at which functional values is required, say it be xp.
    4. Read the step size, say h.
    5. Reduce the equation into system of differential equations.
    6. Set, x=x0 and y=y0;
    7. Compute value of y as below:
            for x=x0 to xp      //Using Euler's Method
                ny=y+f(x,y,z)*h
                nz=z+f(x,y,z)*h
                y=ny
                z=nz
                x=x+h
            end for
    8. Display the functional value, y.
