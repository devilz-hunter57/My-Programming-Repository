Algorithm for Bissection Method
1. Start
2. Choose xl and xu as two guesses for the root such that f(xl)f(xu)<0 and stopping criterion E.
3. Compute f(xl) and f(xu).
4. Estimate the root, xm of the equation f(x)=0 as the mid-point between xl and xu as,
        xm=(xl+xu)/2
5. Now, check the following conditions, 
    a. if f(xl)f(xm)=0, then the root is xm. Go to Step 8.
    b. Else if f(xl)f(xm)<0, the root lies between xl and xm. Set, xu=xm.
    c. Else if, f(xl)f(xm)>0, the root lies between xm and xu. Set, xl=xm.
6. Find the absolute approximate relative error as, 
        |E_ra|=|(xl-xu)/xu|
7. If |Era|>E, then go to Step 3, else go to Step 8.
8. Stop
