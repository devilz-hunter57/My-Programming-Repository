Algorithm
    1. Start
    2. Enter the degree of polynomial, say n.
    3. Enter the value at which polynomial to be evaluated, x.
    4. Initially, set, bn=an;
    5. While, n>0
            bn-1=an-1+bn*x
    6. End While
    7. Display the value of b0, which is the value of polynomial at x.
    8. Terminate
