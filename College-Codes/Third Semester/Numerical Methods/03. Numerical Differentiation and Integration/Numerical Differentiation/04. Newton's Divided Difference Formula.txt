Algorithm
    1. Start
    2. Read the number of data points, say n.
    3. Read n data points.
    4. Read the value at which derivative is needed, say x.
    5. Compute divided differences as below.
        for i = 0 to n-1
            dd[i]=fx[i];
        end for
        for i = 0 to n-1
            for j = n-1 to i+1
                dd[j]=(dd[j]-dd[j-1])/(x[j]-x[j-1-i]);
            end for
        end for
    6. Compute the differentiated values as below.
        Set, v=dd[1]
        for i = 2 to n-1
            term=0
            for j=0 to i
                factor=1;
                for k=0 to i
                if(j!=k)
                {
                    factor=factor*(x-x[k])
                }
                end for
            term=term+factor;
            end for
            vod=vod+dd[i];
        end for
    7. Print the value of first derivative, which is value of variable v.
    8. Terminate
