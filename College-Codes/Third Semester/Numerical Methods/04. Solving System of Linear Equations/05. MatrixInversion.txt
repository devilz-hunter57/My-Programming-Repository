Algorithm
    1. Start
    2. Read the Dimension of Matrix, say it be n.
    3. Read the Coefficient Matrix by Identity Matrix.
    4. Augment the coefficient matrix by identity matrix.
    5. Perform the Elimination Operation as below.
        for k = 1 to n
            pivot=a[k][k];
        for p = 1 to 2n         //Normalize row k
            a[k][p]=a[k][p]/pivot;
        end for
        for i = 1 to n 
            term = a[i][k];
            if(i!=k)
            {
                Multiply row k by "term: and subtract it from row i
            }
        end for
        end for
    6. Display the inverse matrix which is second half of augmented matrix.
    7. Terminate
