Algorithm
    1. Start
    2. Read the Dimension of System of Equations, say it be n.
    3. Read the Coefficients of Argumented Matrix row-wise.
    4. Perform the row operations to convert L.H.S. of the augmented matrix into identity matrix.
        for k = 1 to n
            pivot=a[k][k];
            for p = 1 to n+1            //Normalize row k
                a[k][p]=a[k][p]/pivot;
            for i = 1 to n
                term = a[i][k];
                if(i!=k)
                    Multiply row k by "term" and subtract it from row i.
            End for 
            End for
    5. Display solution vector which is last column of augmented matrix.
    6. Terminate.
