Algorithm
    1. Start
    2. Read the Dimension of System of Equation, say it be n.
    3. Read the Coefficient of Matrix row-wise.
    4. Read the R.H.S. Vector.
    5. Perform forward eliminatino as below,
        for k=1 to n-1
            pivot=a[k][k];
            if(pivot<0.000001)
                Display the message as "Method Failed"
            else
                for i=k+1 to n
                term=a[i][k]/pivot;
                Multiply row k of coefficient matrix by "term" and subtract it from row i.
                Multiply row k of B matrix by "term" and subtract it from row 1.
                End for
        End for
    6. Perform Back Substitution Method as below.
        x[n]=b[n]/a[n][n];
        for i=n-1 to 1
            sum = 0;
            for j= i+1 to n
                sum=sum+a[i][j]*x[j]
            end for
            x[i]=(b[i]-sum)/a[i][i]
        End for
    7. Display solution vector. 
    8. Terminate
