Algorithm
    1. Start
    2. Read the Dimension of System of Equations, say it be n.
    3. Read the Coefficient Matrix row-wise.
    4. Read R.H.S. vector.
    5. Perform the forward elimination as below.
        for k= 1 to n-1
            Find the largest of a[p][k] for p=k, k+1, .... , n
            Swap row k and row p in coefficient matrix
            Swap row k and row p in R.H.S. vector
                    pivot=a[k][k];
            for i=k+1 to n
                term-(a[i][k]/pivot);
                Multiply row k of coefficient matrix by "term" and subtract it from row i
                Multiply row k of B matrix by "term" and subtract it from row i
            End for
        End for
    6. Perform back substitution as below.
        x[n]=b[n]/a[n][n];
        for i=n-1 to 1
            sum=0;
            for j=i+1 to n
                sum=sum+a[i][j]*x[j];
            End for
            x[i]=(b[i]-sum)/a[i][i]
        End for 
    7. Display solution vector. 
    8. Terminate
