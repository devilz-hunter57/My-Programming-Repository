Algorithm
    1. Start
    2. Read the number of point, say it be n.
    3. Read the order of polynomial, say it be m.
    4. Read the given data points, say it be x[i] and fx[i].
    5. Calculate the required summation as below,
        for i= 1 to 2m
            for j= 0 to n-1
                sx[i]=sx[i]+pow(x[j], i);
            End for
        End for
        for i=0 to m
            for j=0 to n-1
                sxy[i]=y[j]*pow(x[j], i);
            End for
        End for
    6. Construct R.H.S. matrix of order (m+1)*(m+1)
    7. Construct L.H.S. matrix of order (m+1)*1
    8. Solve for coefficients a0, a1, ....., am by using gauss elimination method.
    9. Display the equation, 
            y=a0+a1x+a2x^2+.....+amx^m
    10. Terminate
