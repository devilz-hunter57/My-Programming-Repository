Algorithm
1. Start
2. Read the number of points, say n.
3. Read the value at which value is needed, say it be x.
4. Read the given data points.
5. Calculate the values of Li as below:
        for i=1 to n
            for j= 1 to n
                if(j!=i)
                L[i]=L[i]*(x-x[j])/'
                 End if
            End for
        End for
6. Calculate the interpolated value of x as below.
    for i = 1 to n
        v=v+fx[i]*Lx[i];
    End for
7. Print the interpolated value v at x
8. Terminate
