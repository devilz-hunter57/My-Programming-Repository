Algorithm
    1. Start
    2. Read the number of points, say n.
    3. Read the value at which interpolated value is needed, say it be x.
    4. Read the given data points.
    5. Calculate the first divided difference as,
            for i = 0 to n-1
                dd[i]=fx[i];
            end for
    6. Calcuate the second to nth divided differences as, 
            for i=0 to n-1
                for j=n-1 to i+1
                    dd[j]=(dd[j]-dd[j-1])/(x[j]-x[j-1-i]);
                end for
            end for
    7. Set v=0 and p=1
    8. Calculate the interpoated value as, 
            for i = 0 to n-1
                for j = 0 to i - 1 
                    p = p * ( x - xj);
                end for
            v=v+dd[i]*p;
                Reset p-1
            end for
    9. Print the interpolated value v.
    10. Terminate
