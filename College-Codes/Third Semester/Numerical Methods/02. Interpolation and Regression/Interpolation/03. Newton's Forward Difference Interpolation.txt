Algorithm
    1. Start
    2. Read the number of data points, say it be n.
    3. Read the values at whcih interpolated value is needed., say it be xp.
    4. Read n data points, say x[i] and fx[i].
    5. Set, h=x[1]-x[0] and s=(xp-x[0])/h;
    6. Calculate the first forward differences as below, 
            for i = 0 to n-1 
                fd[i]=fx[i];
            End for
    7. Calculate the second to nth forward differences as below, 
            for i=0 to n-1
                for j=n-1 to i+1
                    fd[j]=fd[j]-fd[j-1];
                End for
            End for
    8. Set, v=fd[0] and set, p=1
    9. Calculate the interpolated value as below,
           for i = 1 to n-1
                for k = 1 to i
                    p=p*(s-k+1)
                end for
            v=v+(fd[i]*p/i!)
            Reset p=1
            end for
    10. Print the interpolated value v at xp.
    11. Terminate
